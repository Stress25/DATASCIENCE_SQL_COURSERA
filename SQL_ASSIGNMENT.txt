Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.



Part 1: Yelp Dataset Profiling and Understanding

1. Profile the data by finding the total number of records for each of the tables below:
	
i. Attribute table = 10000
ii. Business table =10000
iii. Category table =10000
iv. Checkin table =10000
v. elite_years table =10000
vi. friend table = 10000
vii. hours table =10000
viii. photo table = 10000
ix. review table = 10000
x. tip table = 10000
xi. user table =10000
	


2. Find the total distinct records by either the foreign key or primary key for each table. If two foreign keys are listed in the table, please specify which foreign key.

i. Business = 10000
ii. Hours = 1562 (business_id key)
iii. Category = 2643 (business_id key)
iv. Attribute = 1115 
v. Review = 9581 (user_id)
vi. Checkin = 493 
vii. Photo = 10000
viii. Tip = 537(user_id)
ix. User = 10000
x. Friend = 11
xi. Elite_years = 2780

Note: Primary Keys are denoted in the ER-Diagram with a yellow key icon.	



3. Are there any columns with null values in the Users table? Indicate "yes," or "no."

	Answer: no

      FROM user 
      WHERE coalesce(id,name,review_count,yelping_since,useful,funny,cool,fans,compliment_photos) IS NULL
	

	
4. For each table and column listed below, display the smallest (minimum), largest (maximum), and average (mean) value for the following fields:

	i. Table: Review, Column: Stars
	
		min:	1	max:	5	avg:3.7082
		
	
	ii. Table: Business, Column: Stars

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
   yes

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         
   yes

iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

 
No , they are located at different neighborhoods.
+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| category    | stars | hours                | review_count | neighborhood |
+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+
| Restaurants |   3.0 | Saturday|11:00-0:00  |          123 |              |
| Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|11:00-20:00 |          168 | Summerlin    |
| Restaurants |   4.0 | Saturday|10:00-23:00 |          768 | Chinatown    |
+-------------+-------+----------------------+--------------+--------------+

SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
category.category
, stars
, hours.hours
, review_count
, neighborhood
FROM (business INNER join category
ON business.id = category.business_id)
INNER JOIN hours ON business.id = hours.business_id 
WHERE city = "Las Vegas" AND category = "Restaurants"
GROUP BY review_count
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
THE CLOSED ONES HAVE HIGH REVIEW COUNT.
         
ii. Difference 2:
    
THE ONES THAT ARE OPEN HAVE HIGHER star RATING THAN CLOSED ONES     
         
         
SQL code used for analysis:

SELECT
 stars
, review_count
, neighborhood
, is_open
FROM business
GROUP BY review_count
HAVING is_open = 0
	
	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         
     I have done the analysis of the corelation between the business category and business city to find the categories with the maximum rating i.e 5/4 stars.  
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:

    I choose the business table and the category table to analyse my study.
     Started with sorting them out based on the no.of maximum stars. This data can 
    help understand the business type and what market is thriving at a particular area.
                         
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

+------------+--------------+-------+--------------+
| city       | category     | stars | review_count |
+------------+--------------+-------+--------------+
| Aurora     | Restaurants  |     4 |           32 |
| Cleveland  | Restaurants  |     5 |          361 |
| Las Vegas  | Asian Fusion |     5 |          768 |
| Phoenix    | Barbeque     |     5 |          431 |
| Pittsburgh | Food         |     5 |           72 |
| Toronto    | Parks        |     4 |           29 |
+------------+--------------+-------+--------------+
         
iv. Provide the SQL code you used to create your final dataset:

SELECT 
city
, category.category
, review.stars
, review_count
FROM (business INNER JOIN category
ON business.id = category.business_id)
INNER JOIN review ON review.business_id = business.id
GROUP BY city
